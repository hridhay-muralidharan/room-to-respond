Start with what happened in your own words. You do not need to explain yourself yet.', context: 'After you write freely, you can add what you felt, thought, said, did, wanted, and noticed afterward. Share only what feels safe to record.', question: 'What happened, and what stayed with you about it?', reason: 'A moment from your life gives the model evidence to work with before it proposes any interpretation or simulation.' },

Imagine it happening after enough sleep, with more support, or with less time pressure than usual.', context: 'There is no preferred response. Notice what changes, what stays, and which conditions seem to matter.', question: 'What changes in your response when the conditions change?', reason: 'Testing whether a pattern is fixed, situational, or connected to a specific need.' },
  { eyebrow: 'Reflection 03 · The other perspective', title: 'A conversation you want to have differently', body: 'Think of a person or situation where you felt misunderstood, unseen, or unable to say what you needed. Consider both what you wanted them to understand and what you were protecting.', context: 'You do not need to excuse anyone or take responsibility for their behaviour. This is an invitation to notice your own experience and options.', question: 'What would you want to be able to say, ask for, or understand?', reason: 'Making room for needs, boundaries, and interpretations without forcing a single story.' },
  { eyebrow: 'Reflection 04 · The unresolved tension', title: 'When two true things pull against each other', body: 'Consider a choice where looking after yourself and meeting someone else’s needs both feel important. Describe the pull without trying to solve it immediately.', context: 'You may feel care and resentment, relief and guilt, hope and fear at the same time. Contradiction is useful information here.', question: 'What are the two truths you are trying to hold at once?', reason: 'Practising language for ambivalence that can make a therapy conversation more precise.' },
  { eyebrow: 'Reflection 05 · Bring it forward', title: 'What would be useful to bring to therapy?', body: 'Look across the moments you have reflected on. Choose one pattern, question, or uncertainty that you would like a qualified clinician to help you explore.', context: 'You are not expected to reach a conclusion. A useful next step might be a concrete example, a question, or a sentence you want help finishing.', question: 'What would you like another person to understand or help you explore?', reason: 'Turning self-observation into a user-owned bridge toward a more focused therapy session.' },
